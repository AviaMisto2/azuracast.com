title: About AzuraCast
---

**AzuraCast** is a self-hosted, all-in-one web radio management kit. Using its easy installer and powerful but intuitive web interface, you can start up a fully working web radio station in a few quick minutes. 

AzuraCast works for web radio stations of all types and sizes, and is built to run on even the most affordable VPS web hosts. The project is named after Azura Peavielle, the mascot of [its predecessor project](https://github.com/SlvrEagle23/Ponyville-Live). AzuraCast also has its own project mascot, [Azura Ruisselante](https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/wiki/Meet-Azura-Ruisselante) created by the talented artist [Tyson Tan](https://tysontan.deviantart.com/).

**AzuraCast is currently in beta.** Many web radio stations already run AzuraCast, but keeping your server up-to-date with the latest code from the GitHub repository is strongly recommended for security, bug fixes and new feature releases. It's unlikely, but updates may result in unexpected issues or data loss, so always make sure to keep your station's media files backed up in a second location.

To install AzuraCast, you should have a basic understanding of the Linux shell terminal. Once installed, every aspect of your radio station can be managed via AzuraCast's simple to use web interface.

## Features

With AzuraCast, you can:

* **Manage your Media:** Upload songs from the web, organize music into folders, and preview songs in your browser.
* **Create Playlists:** Set up standard playlists that play all the time, scheduled playlists for time periods, or special playlists that play once per x songs, or once per x minutes.
* **Set Up Live DJs:** Enable or disable live broadcasting from streamers/DJs, and create individual accounts for each streamer to use.
* **Take Listener Requests:** Let your listeners request specific songs from your playlists, both via an API and a simple public-facing listener page.
* **Track Analytics and Reports:** Keep track of every aspect of your station's listeners over time. View reports of each song's impact on your listener count.
* **Let Station Autopilot Do the Work:** AzuraCast can automatically assign songs to a playlist based on the song's impact on listener numbers. 
* **Delegate Management:** Create and remove separate administrator accounts for each station manager.
* **Build Your Own Radio Player:** AzuraCast's powerful, well-documented API lets you control your station from software built in any programming language.
* **Integrate with TuneIn, Discord and More:** The new web hook system lets you broadcast changes in your station to third party services.
* ...and more.
