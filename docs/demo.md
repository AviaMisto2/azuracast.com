# Live Demo

Want to see AzuraCast for yourself?

We have a demo site with a small AzuraCast installation and a single radio station, where you can see the basics of the AzuraCast web interface in action.

Visit our demo site at [demo.azuracast.com](https://demo.azuracast.com/):

* Username: `demo@azuracast.com`
* Password: `demo`

::: tip Note
The AzuraCast demo instance automatically resets at the top of every hour to a fresh copy. If you try to access the demo site at exactly the top of the hour, you may be automatically redirected back to this page; just try again in a minute or two.
