# Install with Linode

If you are hosting your installation with Linode, you can take advantage of community-maintained StackScripts to install AzuraCast.

1) From the management page, click "Create", then select "New Linode".
2) Switch to the "One-Click" tab at the top, then switch to the "Community StackScripts" secondary tab.
3) Enter "azuracast" in the search box.
4) Choose from either "azuracast-docker" (the recommended Docker installation) or "azuracast" (the non-Docker Ansible installation).
