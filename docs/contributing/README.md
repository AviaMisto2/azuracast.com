## Submitting Code

## Translating AzuraCast

## New Feature Suggestions

Our community votes on what features we should prioritize via a special web site called FeatureUpvote. Visit the [AzuraCast FeatureUpvote Site](https://features.azuracast.com/) to submit new feature ideas or vote on existing ones.

## Join AzuraCast Communities

If you want to chat with other station operators, ask more detailed questions or directly contact the developer team, we have two communities you can join:

 - [AzuraCast on Slack](/slack)
 - [AzuraCast on Disord](/discord)
 
This is the fastest and easiest way to get in touch with us.

As a courtesy to our developers, we ask that you please don't e-mail them directly with any questions. Many questions can be answered by the community or by other developers, so by posting them to GitHub or on Slack, everyone can respond and your issue will likely be resolved faster.

## Follow us on social media!

We frequently post to social media any time there are significant updates to our software, security issues that users should be aware of, or upcoming changes to third-party software. You can get these updates in a more timely fashion by following our accounts:

- @AzuraCast on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/azuracast), or
- @AzuraCast on [FOSStodon (Mastodon)](https://fosstodon.org/@AzuraCast)
