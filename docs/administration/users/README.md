# User Management

## About This Feature

From the "Users" administration panel, you can modify any existing users or create new ones. You can modify the roles that any given user are a part of, and force a password change in the event the user has forgotten their password.

## Required Permissions

To manage users, users must be in a role that has the "Administer Users" permission globally.
