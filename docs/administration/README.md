# System Administration

The AzuraCast system administration page allows you to modify settings that affect the entirety of your AzuraCast installation. This includes creating and managing stations, roles and users, modifying system-wide settings and custom branding, and install relevant closed-source or licensed software.

## Synchronization Tasks

From the main system administration page, global administrators will see a "Synchronization Tasks" section at the bottom. Normally, these synchronization tasks run every 15 seconds, minute, 5 minutes or every hour, but if they aren't running for some reason, you can manually run them from this page in order to view their output logs and diagnose errors.

## Required Permissions

To view the system administration section, users must be in a role that has the "View Administration Page" permission globally.
