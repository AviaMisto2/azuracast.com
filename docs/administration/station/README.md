# Station Management

## About This Feature

From the "Stations" administration panel, you can modify any existing stations, remove them from the server, create new ones, or "clone" an existing station to create a new one with the same settings (and optionally, the same media, playlists, etc.).

## Required Permissions

To manage stations, users must be in a role that has the "Administer Stations" permission globally.
