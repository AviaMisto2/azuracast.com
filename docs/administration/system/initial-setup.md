# Initial System Setup

Once installation is complete, you should immediately visit your server's public web address. This may be the IP of the server, a domain name (if you've registered one and pointed it at the server), or `localhost` if you're running AzuraCast on your personal computer.

The initial web setup consists of the following steps:
1. Creating a "Super Administrator" account with system-wide administratration permissions
2. Creating the first radio station that the system will manage
3. Customizing important AzuraCast settings, like the site's base URL and HTTPS settings

Don't worry if you aren't sure of these items yet; you can always make changes to any of the items after setup is complete.
