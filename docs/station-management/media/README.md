# Media Management

## About This Feature

Media management is at the core of AzuraCast's built-in AutoDJ. By uploading media and assigning it to a playlist, the AutoDJ will automatically compose a live stream broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

You can upload media directly via your web browser, by either selecting files or clicking and dragging them into a section at the top of the Media Manager.

Note that for your AutoDJ to detect any files in your Media Manager, they **must** be added to at least one playlist.

## Auto-Assigning Folders to Playlists

From the media manager, you can select a folder, select "Set Playlists" and assign the folder to a playlist.

Once assigned to a playlist, any files added to the folder will automatically be added to those same playlists. The system won't remove any additional playlists that the media is in, but it will add the missing ones from the folder.

## Required Permissions

To manage media, users must be in a role that has the "Manage Station Media" permission for the given station.
