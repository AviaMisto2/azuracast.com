# Mount Points

Mount Points are how listeners connect and listen to your broadcasts.

Each Station in AzuraCast represents one single broadcast (with one currently playing title, artist, etc.), but with multiple Mount Points you can output that broadcast in multiple formats (i.e. MP3, Ogg Vorbis) or bitrates (i.e. 128kbps or 64kbps).

## Required Permissions

To manage mount points, users must be in a role that has the "Manage Station Mount Points" permission for the given station.
