In order to help ensure a uniform streaming experience across multiple broadcasting technologies, AzuraCast harnesses LiquidSoap (the AutoDJ software)'s built in DJ support system. Accounts for streamers/DJs can be added directly inside the AzuraCast web panel, and the streamers will immediately have access to send a live broadcast as soon as they are added.
