# BUTT (Broadcast Using This Tool)

Cross-platform and available for free at https://sourceforge.net/projects/butt/. Streaming via both IceCast mode and ShoutCast mode are available.

### IceCast Mode

Use the exact information specified on the Streamer/DJ page's right sidebar. "Address" is "Server" and "Icecast mountpoint" is "Mount Name".

### ShoutCast Mode

BUTT will automatically add 1 to the port number you specify if used in ShoutCast mode, so use the port specified in the "IceCast Clients" section. Since ShoutCast v1 does not let you specify a username, specify your password as `dj_username:dj_password` (the username and password for the DJ separated by a colon).
