# Mixxx

[Mixxx](https://www.mixxx.org) is free and open-source DJ software that also supports live broadcasting via IceCast and ShoutCast servers.

Live broadcasting settings can be found in the preferences menu (`Options` -> `Preferences`). It is recommended to use "Icecast 2" mode when broadcasting to AzuraCast. Out of the box, Mixxx does not include the LAME MP3 encoder (for licensing reasons), but it is not needed when connecting to AzuraCast; just set your broadcast format to 'Ogg Vorbis' and LiquidSoap will transcode the broadcast into the correct output format.
